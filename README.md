<h1>PHPJS</h1>
<p>PHPJS is an attempt to implement the Document Object Model (DOM) in PHP that was more inline with current standards.
	While PHP does already have its own impelmentation of the DOM, it is somewhat outdated and is more geared towards
	XML/XHTML/HTML4.  This is very much a work in progress and as a result things may be broken.</p>
